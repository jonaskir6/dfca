EMNIST Experiments on CNN with p=2:

1. dfca-li, dfca-gi & ifca with lr=0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 5 different seeds on m, n = 1200, 200 (100 epochs) ca. 14h

2. dfca-gi (lr=0.001) and ifca (lr=0.1) with 5 different seeds on m, n = 1200, 200 (200 epochs) ca 9h

3. dfca-gi (lr=0.001) and ifca (lr=0.1) with 5 different seeds on m, n = 2400, 100 (200 epochs)

4. dfca-gi (lr=0.001) and ifca (lr=0.1) with 5 different seeds on m, n = 4800, 50 (200 epochs)
