# MNIST EXPERIMENTS
### To run the experiments yourself, simply run all cells inside the result-notebooks you wish to run

### To reproduce our results, run with random.seed(42)

## exp_cl_acc

- Detailed experiments on clustering accuracy of DFCA-GI and IFCA with different participation rates
- Results can be found in 'result.ipynb

## exp_dfca-gi:

- Experiments on cifar using IFCA with lr=0.25, m=200, n=500, lambda=30, p_rate=0.5
- Graphs can be found in 'graphs' folder or in the notebook
- Results can be found in 'result.ipynb'

## exp_ifca:

- Experiments on cifar using IFCA with lr=0.25, m=200, n=500, p_rate=0.5
