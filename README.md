# Decentralized Federated Clustering Algorithm (DFCA)

- a synchronous simulation of the decentralzied federated clustering algorithm with mnist, emnist and cifar10
- codebase: https://github.com/jichan3751/ifca
- Code for my Bachelor Thesis written at TU-Dortmund (Department of Artificial Intelligence, Prof. Harmeling) and Fraunhofer-ISST (Department of Mobility and Smart Cities, M.Sc. Sebasian Becker)

## Folders:

- Each folder contains a "python" and "notebooks" folder. To run our experiments it is suggested to run the notebooks.
- To run the python experiments run ```python run.py```
